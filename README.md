# iStudy
iStudy is building a library search engine for all the libraries in British Columbia. App administrators and library administrators will be able to add, change and update data on the database. Users can sign up with a email to own an user ID and can manage their profiles such as adding their home address. The general users are able to search for libraries that best fit their need by using a different method like selecting a district and entering in an address or a postal code. The data can be displayed in a wide variety such as plots on a map or a table sorted by distance. A link is also available to direct users to the libraries website so they can find out more information about the library. They can also add their favorite libraries and manage them on their account for future use. In addition, the library list can be shared to their Facebook page by clicking on the Facebook button. As for guest users, you can enjoy the same searching features as regular users but you cannot save any of your personal information for the future.
